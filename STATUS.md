# Build a Brain — Status

**Status:** Phases 1-4 SHIPPED (Phase 1: 2026-08-24, Phase 2: 2026-08-25,
Phase 3: 2026-08-25, Phase 4: 2026-08-27) — live on GitHub Pages.

Repo: https://github.com/turlockmike/build-a-brain

## Done so far

- Full app scaffold: `index.html` + `app.js` + `sw.js` + `manifest.json` +
  `icon.svg` + `.nojekyll`, vanilla JS / no build step, matching the
  kana-cards/word625-cards/latin-cards family pattern.
- Roadmap view: all 14 phases visible as a vertical path/timeline. Any phase
  with lesson content in `LESSONS` unlocks and expands automatically (see
  `renderRoadmap()` in `app.js`, generalized 2026-08-25 from a Phase-1-only
  special case) — with per-lesson status + quiz score once complete, and a
  phase-level progress bar. Phases with no content yet render as locked
  "coming soon" cards showing only their title — full path visible, nothing
  hidden, nothing else clickable until it has content.
- Lesson view: objectives, explanation, worked example, 3-5 practice problems
  (reveal-to-check), 5-question quiz with instant right/wrong feedback per
  question and an end-of-quiz score + encouragement message. Prev/next lesson
  navigation.
- Progress tracking in `localStorage` only (`bab_progress_v1`): started /
  complete / quiz score per lesson, phase progress bar, overall progress bar.
  No account, no login, no backend.
- Offline support: service worker (`sw.js`, cache `bab-v5` as of the Phase 4
  ship) caches the whole app shell on first load; works with no network after
  that. Cache version gets bumped every time new phase content ships so
  returning users' service workers pick it up.
- **Phase 1 (Math Foundations I) content: 20/20 lessons fully written** —
  number sense through the coordinate plane, ending in a mini-project puzzle
  lesson that combines equation-solving, the distributive property, and
  negative numbers.
- **Phase 2 (Programming Foundations I — Python) content: 17/17 lessons fully
  written** — starts at "what is a program?" (print, comments), through
  variables, arithmetic/string operators, f-strings, if/elif/else, comparison
  and boolean operators, while and for loops, range(), lists (indexing,
  len(), append()), the accumulator pattern, and functions (parameters,
  return values), ending in a mini-project (a quiz-grader program) that
  combines every tool from the phase into one working program. Each lesson
  assumes only Phase 1 + earlier Phase 2 lessons — verified by spot-check
  (2.1, 2.13, 2.17) during the ship pass.
  Each lesson has real explanatory text (not filler), a worked example,
  practice problems with full solutions, and a 5-question quiz.
- **Phase 3 (How Brains Work) content: 15/15 lessons fully written** — starts
  at "what is a neuron?" (with a scale estimate callback to Phase 1's
  rounding skills), through neuron anatomy (dendrites/cell body/axon),
  electrical firing and the all-or-nothing threshold rule, crossing the
  synapse (presynaptic/postsynaptic, neurotransmitters), synaptic strength,
  "neurons that fire together wire together," why single neurons are limited
  but many-to-many networks aren't, layered pattern recognition, learning and
  memory as strengthened connections, forgetting as weakened connections,
  weighing many excitatory/inhibitory signals against a threshold, reflex
  circuits, specialized brain regions, and the bridge from biological neurons
  to the artificial neuron (naming the weights/threshold/layers mapping
  without teaching any of the math — that's reserved for Phase 8+), ending in
  a mini-project that traces a hand-worked 3-neuron circuit combining every
  idea from the phase. Every lesson assumes only Phase 1 + Phase 2 + earlier
  Phase 3 lessons — no forward references to Phase 8's perceptron math or
  Phase 9's calculus; the phase stays conceptual/biological throughout, as
  Mike's progressive-levels constraint requires.
- **Phase 4 (Logic & Computing Basics) content: 12/12 lessons fully written** —
  starts at what a bit is and why computers use two-state switches instead of
  ten (with an explicit callback to Phase 3's all-or-nothing neuron firing),
  through binary<->decimal conversion, binary addition with carrying, and
  bits/bytes representing more than numbers (2^N combinations, ASCII);
  then AND/OR/NOT gates and truth tables, NAND/NOR/XOR, combining gates into
  small circuits, and a lesson that explicitly pays off Phase 3's own
  forward-reference by connecting a gate's HIGH/LOW output to the same
  threshold-decision shape as a neuron firing; then Boolean logic in Python
  (and/or/not ARE the gates), if/elif/else traced as gate-circuit decisions,
  a half adder (XOR for sum, AND for carry, directly reusing binary addition
  from 4.3), ending in a mini-project (a fish-tank alarm decision circuit)
  that combines binary, gates, and the threshold-decision idea into one
  worked design. Every lesson assumes only Phase 1-3 + earlier Phase 4
  lessons — content was generated in 3 lesson-groups (4.1-4.4, 4.5-4.8,
  4.9-4.12) each briefed on the prior groups' coverage to keep the
  progressive-dependency constraint intact, then schema-validated
  programmatically (12/12 lessons: correct id/number sequence, non-empty
  objectives/explanation/practice, exactly 5 quiz questions each) before
  merging into `data/curriculum.js`.
- Deployed: pushed to `main` on `turlockmike/build-a-brain`, GitHub Pages
  enabled serving from `main` / root (same setup as kana-cards). Verified
  live with a `curl -sI` 200 check + a content check on `data/curriculum.js`
  post-deploy, for the Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 ships.

## Pending — next session(s)

- **Phases 5-14 have no lesson content yet** — only their phase titles show
  in the roadmap as locked/coming-soon. Per Mike: build this out phase by
  phase across future sessions, not all at once ("chained background builds
  through the day" per his 2026-08-25 ask).
- Next up: Phase 5, "Statistics & Data — mean/median/variance/std dev,
  probability, expected value, what a dataset is, train/test split
  intuition." Needs its own lesson-title breakdown (like Phase 1-4 got)
  before full lesson content in the same schema.
- Not done, optional backlog: multi-learner profiles (kana-cards has this
  pattern if wanted later), a lightweight math-notation renderer (KaTeX-style)
  if plain-text exponents/fractions ever feel cramped, print/export view.
